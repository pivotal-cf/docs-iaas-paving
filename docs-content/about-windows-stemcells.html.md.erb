## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

A _stemcell_ is a customized operating system image containing the filesystem for BOSH-managed virtual machines. When deployed, it includes a process, the _BOSH Agent_, which is pre-configured to communicate with the orchestrating VM, the _BOSH Director_.
The BOSH Agent is responsible for executing and monitoring jobs on the VM.

PAS for Windows 2012R2 deployments currently use a stemcell based on Windows Server 2012 R2.

## <a id="sizing"></a> Root Disk Sizing

The size of the stemcell's root disk determines the minimum root disk size of any Windows VM that the BOSH Director can create from that stemcell. The relationship between a stemcell's disk size and the root disk size of the Windows cells depends on your IaaS as shown in the table below.

Stemcell 1200.17 and 1709.5 onwards, we have disabled root disk resizing and have provided large root disks. In the near future, we would provide a way to control the disk size for your Windows VM. 

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong>Below table is applicable for 1200.17+ and 1709.5+</p>

<sup>\*</sup> See the [limitations](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/windows/index.html#limitations) section about 1709 for Amazon Web Services

<sup>\**</sup>Because you create your own stemcell on vSphere, you can control its root disk size. See [Creating a vSphere Stemcell Manually](./vsphere-stemcell-build.html) for more information.

In the PAS for Windows 2012R2 tile > **Resource Config** pane, the VM types that you can choose from reflect the disk size constraints in the table above.

## <a id="light-stemcells"></a> Light Stemcells

_Light stemcells_ are metadata files that enable you to deploy VMs without uploading the full operating system manually. These stemcells reference images of Windows Server 2012 R2 hosted on public IaaSes.

Light stemcells are available for Microsoft Azure, AWS, and GCP, which typically bill a surcharge for the associated Windows licensing cost. See the documentation on those IaaSes for details.

Below is IaaS-specific documentation for light stemcells you can use with the PAS for Windows 2012R2 tile:

## <a id="stemcell-builds"></a> Stemcell Builds

Because of the constraints placed on the distribution of Windows OS by Microsoft's licensing terms, operators must build stemcells for on-premise deployments from OS disk images (e.g. ISO files) licensed to them directly from Microsoft. This typically involves starting a Windows virtual machine, installing the BOSH agent and associated software, then exporting its disk image and converting it to a stemcell format.
